# Pomodoro

A classic pomodoro timer app - retain fresh mind when working on focus-intensive tasks.

The pomodoro technique is simple, yet effective. Set the timer and work without interruption on your task. After the timer rings - take a short break. Repeat until you get the job done.

## Features

- Customizable durations and daily goal,
- Night owl mode - donâ€™t lose your progress when working to late hours (after the midnight),
- Dark/light mode.

## The motivation

The pomodoro app was my first ever own-built project. While the original version was written in pure JS, it became unmaintainable and hard to work on.

With all the knowledge I gained through the years, I rewritten it using React, TypeScript and used Redux Toolkit for state management. I also learnt about listener middleware in RTK, which made managing related-information in the state much easier. I also incorporated experimental Temporal API for operating on dates.
